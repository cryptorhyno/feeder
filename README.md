These settings are purely used by me with continuous changes

I use PT Defender with appsettings_BTC_Anish & appsettings_ETH_Anish
1. appsettings_BTC_Anish: These settings have been faithfully generating an average of 0.5 to 1.8% per day of profit.
2. appsettings_BTC_Smiley_LowBalance: For low balance, the changes I do different from default smiley settings are
    a. "InitialCost": "0.003"
    b. "MaxTradingPairs": "2"
3. appsettings_BTC_Smiley: Yet to explore
4. appsettings_ETH_Anish: Still not upto mark
5. appsettings_ETH_Smiley_LowBalance: Same as #2
6. appsettings_ETH_Smiley: Yet to explore
